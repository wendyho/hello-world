# hello-world
Hi everyone! I'm a junior in high school and I really want to learn how to code but I don't know where to start. My goal is to code a simple cooking calculator app that could potentially be released in the apple store or something like that. But first, I actually have to learn to code. If you have any advice, please feel free to tell me.!
